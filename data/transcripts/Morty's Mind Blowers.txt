[Open Int. M.C. Escher's "Relativity"-esque Dimension]

[Rick and Morty are being chased by a goth-looking creature. They are carrying a tortoise that is covered in crystals.]

Rick: Morty, hurry!
Goth Creature: Return the Truth Tortoise! [chases after them]
Rick: Morty, whatever you do, don't drop the Truth Tortoise! Also, really important--whatever you do, don't look into its eyes!
Morty: I-I did look at it, Rick! I've been looking at it!
Rick: Now you're gonna know everything, Morty! [the Goth Creature almost catches up after them] Good job! Way to go! You fucked everything up!
[Morty hears the Truth Tortoise's speech in his head]
Morty: It's in my head! Oohhhh!!
[Morty throws the Truth Tortoise down a pink vortex before the Goth Creature could get it back. The dimension starts collapsing from its foundations until--]
[Open Ext. Smith Residence]

[Trans. Int. Living Room. A distressed, baggy-eyed Morty sits down on the couch with Rick.]

Morty: Oh, geez... I-I can't get that Truth Tortoise out of my head.
Rick: [sits down] Yeah, I told you not to look into its eyes. Hey, Morty, let's watch some Interdimensional Cable. Remember how we used to do that?
Morty: Rick, I can't-- I can't go on. I-I can't go on like this with the Truth Tortoise shit in my head. I-I wish you could just--
Rick: [nonchalantly] Erase the memory from your mind?
Morty: [suspicious] How did you know I was gonna say that?
Rick: Come on, Morty, come with me.
[Trans. Int. Rick's Garage. Rick opens the hatch to his secret underground lab with Morty.]

Rick: After you.
[Trans. Int. Archive Room. Morty and Rick enter a large circular room filled with red, blue and purple vials across the room, with a large chair and a helmet beside it.]

Morty: What the hell is this?!
Rick: This, Morty, is my archive of all the experiences you've begged me to remove from from your life, [puts a purple vial in a section] lest you go insane. I call them "Morty's Mind Blowers"! [breaks the fourth wall to the camera] And we'll be doing this instead of Interdimensional Cable.
[END OF COLD OPEN]

Act One
[Int. Archive Room. Morty looks at the numerous vials in disbelief with Rick checking in the background.]

Morty: How long have I been asking you to remove memories?
Rick: Since the first [burps] time your mind was blown. [picks up a blue vial] Ah, here it is. [burps] Classic. [blows vial. As Morty comes over, Rick puts the helmet on Morty and has him sit down on the chair] There's no dust on it because this isn't the first time we've done this.
Morty: What?!
Rick: I call this "Moonspiracy"! Ha-ha-ha-ha-hah! [inserts the blue vial into the helmet, presses a button and zoom into Morty's rolled-up eyes--]
[Trans. Ext. Smith Residence; Night. Morty is looking at the full moon through the telescope. He sees the Apollo 11 lunar module and American flag on the moon's surface.]

Morty: Huh, wow. That's incredible. [rotates view to the left. A strange figure standing in a mid-stride walking pose gazes at Morty] What the heck?! [the man then smiles sinisterly]
[Trans. Int. Dining Room. Morty explains his story to Beth, Summer and Rick at the table.]

Beth: Morty, do you realize how ridiculous that sounds?
Rick: Yeah, pretty crazy story, Morty. [Morty is outraged]
Morty: Are you serious?! Half the crap we've seen, and you think that sounds crazy?!
Rick: I've been to 300 versions of Earth's moon, including this one, and I've never seen signs of a "regular dude," as you describe him, hanging out up there.
Summer: [uncaring] It's probably just a smudge on the lens.
Morty: Smudge on the lens?! SMUDGE ON THE LENS?!! I know the difference between a man threatening me and a smudge on the goddamn lens, Summer!!
Beth: Morty, calm down! Are you feeling okay?
Morty: I'M FINE!! [angrily leaves the table and runs upstairs]
Beth: So sensitive.
[Open Ext. Harry Herpson High School; Day.]

[Trans. Int. Classroom. Morty is drawing sketches of the moon man's head in a crescent moon shape. Principal Vagina enters the classroom.]

Principal Vagina: Kids, I'd like to introduce you all to our new guidance counselor, Mr. Lunas. [the moon man enters the classroom. Morty drops his pencil in shock]
Mr. Lunas: I look forward to helping guide you all towards a brighter future. I believe every student should... [smiles sinisterly] shoot for the moon. [Morty feels tense for a beat]
[Open Ext. Suburbs; Night. Mr. Lunas walks down the street holding the tattered American flag as Morty eavesdrops behind a bush with his phone at the ready.]

Morty: Got you now, you son of a bitch. [takes pictures as Lunas plants flag on a front lawn]
[Open Ext. Harry Herpson High School; Day.]

[Trans. Principal's Office. Morty slams the pictures on Vagina's desk in front of him.]

Principal Vagina: What's this?
Morty: Proof that Mr. Lunas isn't who he says he is!
Principal Vagina: He's not a guidance counselor?
Morty: I-I assume he's qualified to be one, who isn't? But he also lives on the moon!
Principal Vagina: [pause] Okay. Hmm... Is that it? Is he doing anything to hurt anyone?
Morty: Oh, he's up to something.
Principal Vagina: I...think I understand. "Up to something," "lives on the moon." Okay, I'll talk to him.
[Trans. Parking Lot. Morty watches through the window as Vagina confronts Lunas at the parking lot. They argue, Vagina punches Lunas in the face and orders him to leave. Lunas gets into his green pickup truck and drives away. Morty runs outside to Vagina]

Morty: What did he say?
Principal Vagina: Denied the moon stuff, but that's what pedophiles do. They deny, it's their bread and butter.
Morty: "Pedophile"?
Principal Vagina: You don't think so? I thought the moon thing might have been code.
Morty: No, he's literally from the moon!
Principal Vagina: Well, you saw react. [points] Moon or not, that dude likes 'em young.
[Open Ext. Suburbs. Morty rides on his bicycle. He then sees police officers investigating the front lawn Mr. Lunas was at previously, and a first response ambulance driving away from the scene.]

[Open Ext. Cemetery. Three Marines stand before an unburied coffin in a funeral as Morty eavesdrops behind a bush.]

Marine: Gordon Lunas was a good Marine. We don't know what drove him to take his own life, but we want to remember the good things. Like how, from a certain angle, some people would say he looked like a smudge. [Morty gapes in horror]
[Trans. Ext. Smith Residence; Night. Morty runs back home to see the smudge on the telescope's lens through the full moon. He touches the smudge and realizing his mistake.]

Morty: Oh, my God, what have I done?! What have I done..?!
Jesus, I made that guy kill himself!

Only in a literal sense.

Here's one I call "Morty's ( burp ) Menagerie."

They don't all have titles, though.

It's not a "Simpsons"

Halloween special, more like a clip show made of clips you never saw!

I can't believe we got put into a menagerie.

So this guy collects living beings?

Yeah, you know like commemorative plates, but less off-putting.

You'll get it when you're still actively dating in your 40s.

Assess this with cold indifference, you beany-headed prick!

( Crash! )

Hey, keep it down!

Just our luck, menagerie beneath the "boulder people" of Granitor Seven.

I can't take it anymore, Rick!

( Banging )

Relax, Morty!

I can't relax! R-R-Rick, we -- we gotta get outta here!

I don't care what it takes!

Anything!

Anything?

All right, well, you're gonna have to take off your shirt.

Not yet.

I'll tell you when.

( Sonar pinging )

( Chattering )

Dear God.

What?

The signal turned out to be -- there's no other way to put it --

Instructions.

For?

A vehicle, sir, an interstellar vehicle.

We'll need a pilot.

I wonder if there's a volunteer.

Mm.

Oh, the schematics specify a second, smaller pilot.

I mean, they really specify smaller.

They have to be exactly 5'3".

Here are some customary clothing gifts.

Please, put them on.

Of course, yes.

We followed your instructions.

We have so much to learn from you.

I know, right?

( Creak )

Hey, how come I was able to see those other people's memories?

I -- I wouldn't have been around for that.

Yeah, sometimes I gotta do a little editing, Morty.

It helps the mind blowers play a little bit better upon revisiting.

I call this one "The Whole Enchilada.

Here, Morty, this'll make your urine drinkable.

Now can we keep shopping?

I am Zikzak.

Ah, sh1t, Morty, get behind me.

It's a f*ckin' alien overlord!

It's okay.

Here.

Oh, I misjudged.

"I am Floop Floopian.

Please kill me."

That's right, Morty.

The Floop Floopians achieve an eternal orgasmic afterlife, so long as they're killed by a great warrior.

I'm flattered, by the way.

Thank you very much.

So you're gonna kill him?

Eh, let's get some lunch first.

So, you want to get shot in the head, or --

Well, as long as the wound is fatal, I don't really mind where you shoot me.

Cool.

I'm gonna go take a quick sh1t.

Well, I gotta say.

You know, I'm a little envious.

Your species has an actual afterlife.

That's gotta be nice.

Wh-What do you mean?

Well, you know, here on Earth, w-we don't know what's going on.

It must be nice for you guys to, you know, have that -- have that proof's in the pudding, you know, evidence.

Evidence?

There's supposed to be evidence?

Um, yeah, uh... otherwise, how do you know if it's true?

Wait, you don't...

I shouldn't have let you make me doubt it!

Aah!

I blame you, I blame you!

But he said there wasn't any evidence!

That was a ton of evidence!

Well, silver lining.

Now I know their religion's real.

They have a hell, and it does not look good.

I noticed you never finished your chimichanga, so I got some room for it now, if you know what I mean.

Holy sh1t!

How many of these are just horrible mistakes I've made?

I mean, maybe I'd stop making so many if I let myself learn from them!

Don't break your back creating a lesson, Morty.

It's a freeform anthology.

I'm getting annoyed you're not hearing that.

As you can see around me, your mind's been blown countless times, and not always by yourself.

Ah, sh1t, I don't even --

This better not have been a good one.

What is this?

( Voice echoing )

Your Morty is gone!

I am Voltamatron, Destroyer of Worlds!

Grandpa Rick, there must be some scientific way to save him!

Not scientific, but there may be a way.

Morty, I know you're in there.

It's me, your grandpa.

I know I can be mean, but I love you, Morty.

We all do, you gotta fight this thing.

I know you can.

You're stronger than all of us!

Morty, it's mom! We love you, you have to fight it!

Come on, Morty!

Fight that stupid worm thing!

We love you!

You're doing it!

Should we pull it out?

No, don't touch it.

We still love you.

But I do have a thing at 6:00.

Oh, God, do I have to keep looking?

Geez, Morty, come on, pinch it off already!

( Laughter )

( Screaming )

Don't! Oh, God, sorry, Morty, I love you!

( Whimpering )

God, is there going to be an intermission?

Excuse me, but I ordered the large evil space worm.

I know, it's like, is that a demon slug in your stomach, or are you just happy to --

( Screaming )

Sorry!

Well, I guess it's nice to know the whole family sucks!

So if the blues ones are my fault, and the purple ones are my family's, what are the red ones?

Yeah, d-don't read into it, Morty!

( Birds chirping )

Ahh.

sh1t! We need to find shelter before the sunset, Morty.

Venzenulon Nine has a night temperature of 300 below!

We'll freeze, Morty!

W-We'll be dead in seconds!

I -- I think I saw a cave over there.

You've seen too many movies, Morty.

A cave isn't gonna cut it.

We're gonna have to use Beebo.

Beebo led us to water!

He's our friend!

He won't even feel it!

Oh, no, no!

( Beebo groans )

You wanna die, Morty?

Get in Beebo!

Oh, no, no!

Brace for the ice limit.

Here it comes!

Wait, are we on Venzenulon Nine or Venzenulon Seven?

Wait a minute, why would I ask for that to be removed?

Are the red ones stuff you wanted removed?

Ooh, that's clever, Morty, but I don't use color to sort things because I'm not a mouse in a European children's book.

Then why are all those pink ones by the liquor?

Liquor?

( Ray guns blasting )

( Both sigh )

sh1t, that was close.

We lost Captain Sky.

He gave his life for the uprising.

Yeah. It really makes you think, huh, Morty?

We should never take things for granite.

What?

I'm just saying, life's short.

We shouldn't take things for granite.

Are you saying "granite"?

Well, yeah.

It's "granted," with a "D."

Take things for granted.

Did you actually think it was --

( Laughs )

Jesus Christ, Rick, what are you, a boulder -- a rock person?

How long have you been saying that wrong?

Oh, you like that, huh?

I b-b-bet that really blows your mind.

I mean, yeah, it's kind of great.

You want me to erase it?

What, you can do that?

( Buzzing )

Ah, sh1t.

I f*ckin' knew it, you piece of sh1t!

You -- You --

You're a f*ckin' asshole, Rick!

Just relax.

No, I'm not gonna f*ckin' relax!

Come here!

Let go of me, you little bitch!

I'm gonna grab you by the scruff of your --

Take that!

Ohh!

Umm.

Umm. Uhh.

What --

What's going on?

Where am I?

Who are we?

Who am I?

I think I'm an adolescent boy.

Huh, and I'm an elderly man.

And we appear to be in some kind of secret confined space.

Yeah, umm...

Don't look at me like that.

For all we know, you could be the f*ckin' weirdo.

Huh, these things are obviously storage units, and since we can't remember what went wrong, my guess is that the technology involves memory, and that this thing on your head is designed to...

Tell us the code, jagoff!

( Speaking alien language )

It's pointless.

He's stonewalling.

Rick, if we don't unlock those vaccines, Earth dies!

You know, it might be time to step up your interrogation!

Not sure what you're implying, Morty, but some lines I don't cross.

Yeah, well, I crossed every line I had when this b*st*rd tried to kill Jessica!

( Speaking alien language )

Okay, see those two fleshy sacs under his chin, Morty?

Grab 'em.

You remember the codes now?

Twist!

( Screaming )

Give us the codes, man!

Twist harder, Morty!

Harder!

( Screaming )

Okay, let go, let go, let him breathe.

( Speaking alien language )

He wants to make a deal.

Half the codes now, half after you finish.

But can we trust --

Wait, what?

F-Finish what?

Y-You know --

I thought I was torturing him!

Oh, and this disappoints you?

Do I tell him we don't have a deal, Morty?

Because if we can kill our enemies, but we can't jack them off, then how are we better than them?

Well, what did you find out?

We're partners, I guess, and we fight aliens, like "Men in Black"?

"Men in Black,"

"Men in Black."

I have "Men in Black 2" in here.

So -- So you get the general idea.

( Laughs )

Not quite.

It's basically an endless string of callbacks to --

All right, save it for Youtube.

I'll keep looking for clues.

What are you doing?

You want your shelf level or not?

And if I say yes, you're gonna provide that for me with that?

Yes, see the bubble?

I'm familiar with the bubble, Morty.

I also dabble in precision, and if you think you can even approach it with your sad, naked, caveman eyeball and a bubble of f*cking air, you're the reason this species is a failure, and it makes me angry!

You're drunk.

You want to put up a shelf, put up a shelf.

You want to experience true level?

Do you?

Y-yes.

Ugh, all right, come on.

Wow, it's so --

Oh, oh, oh, oh, my God, oh, Christ, ooh, ooh, ooh, ahh.

Oh, yeah, true level, bitch.

Morty, come on, we're leaving for school.

Oh, everything's crooked!

Reality is poison!

I want to go back!

I hate this!

What's his deal?

Can't live like this!

Shh, shh, shh, shh, Morty, Morty, Morty.

Go to school, Summer.

I'll go in Morty's memory and do a little --

( Clicks tongue )

Lambs to the cosmic slaughter!

Well?

You seem to be in charge of what I get to remember.

Why?

Good question.

Morty, I need darkness to prime these optical inductors.

Hit the leftmost light switch by the door for me.

The left.

( Click, click, click )

Okay, lights on.

( Sighs )

So, did I just hear three distinct light switch clicks?

W-W-What do you mean?

I feel like the three sounds I heard could be explained by an initial erroneous flipping of a switch on the right followed by a hasty, corrective flipping of the requested switch.

Then during the resultant darkness and silence, a third, shameful unflipping of the initially flipped switch.

Is my assessment accurate?

Yeah, that's -- that's basically how -- how it all shaked out.

I'm sorry.

Ugh.

All right, come on.

What?!

Come on!
