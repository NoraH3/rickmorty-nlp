We got to go! 
You got to come with me, Jerry! 
Rick? 
It's important, Jerry. 
( Burps ) The fate of the galaxy rests on your shoulders. 
Let's go. 
Put some pants on. 
N-Never mind, there's no time for pants, Jerry. 
I'll make you a pair of pants on the way. 
It's a Rick and Jerry adventure!

He's -- He's good with regular folk." 
This is a real situation where -- where -- where Jerry could really shine. 
He's a master convincer."

I know what this is. 
Oh. Okay, well, I told Morty, "Look, parents get divorced. 
They get sad. He'll be fine," but I think he's worried you're gonna, you know...Pbht! 
And you know how Morty gets when he gets emotional. 
It impedes my work. 
So, I told him I'd take you out and give you a win. 
Wait. My son asked you to take me on some kind of pity adventure to keep me from killing myself? 
Wait, w-what did you think it was? 
An execution. 
Geez! 
You really do need a win. 
No! 
I-I don't know. 
I mean, you never made me the pants, so -- 
So, you thought I was gonna drive you into the middle of the galaxy and shove you into the vacuum of space with your dick hanging out? 
And we're seeing how you'd act if that were about to happen? 
I mean sh1t I'll make you the pants right now. 
Take me two seconds to make you pants. 
I have pants at home! 
Jerry, if I make pants, they'll be better than your pants at home. 
Also, if I wanted to kill you -- 
Yeah, I get it. 
It would be amazing. 
Please, take me home. 
I'll tell my son we had an amazing adventure. 
Well, if it's all the same, could we go get our story straight? 
Because you're a terrible liar. 
You called me a master convincer! 
You believed me? 
Huh. This seems... kind of fancy. 
Jerry, for all you know, this is the equivalent of an alien truck stop. 
You have no frame of reference. 
You're in a universe beyond your imagining. 
But, yes, it is super fancy. 
I mean, my job here is to make Morty happy. 
I'm not gonna take you somewhere dangerous.

I told you if I ever saw your face in here again, I would stick you like the pig you are.

Got it. 
The perfect place to take the most fragile being in the universe. 
I can tell you expect me to refute that, but it's right on the money. 
If I come home without you, I doubt Morty's gonna let me off the hook. 
Yeah, but what if you came home with Jeff Goldblum. 
Jeff Goldblum? 
What the f*ck are you talking about, Jerry?

My kingdom was usurped by force with weapons and technology supplied by your father-in-law! 
Hey, he usurped my kingdom, too, man. 
He basically got me kicked out of my home, stole my family. 
Then we are brothers, and you have wondered what your life could have been without Rick. 
Wondered? Sure. 
I mean, I've wondered about having a v*g1n*. 
Would you help me kill him? 
What? No! 
He's my wife's father.

Oh, you really moved on. 
There is a popular attraction here called the Whirly Dirly. 
Between the first whirly and the third dirly, the ride dips just outside the immortality field. 
You're asking me to lure Rick to his death? 
I'm only asking you to go on a ride with Rick, get off the ride without Rick, and go home to your family, where you can... wonder about having a v*g1n*. 
Okay, okay, that was a very specific example pulled from thin air. 
I don't want to be known as the v*g1n* guy.
