It starts with a train zooming through space. A man walks into a Star Wars canteen-themed car, where he is greeted by the Tickets Please Guy.)

Tickets Please Guy: Tickets, please.

(The man gives him a ticket, to which he tears off one half and returns it to the man. Indistinct chatter is heard as the man sits at the stools, to which another man greets him.)

Ramamama Leader: Barkeep. A drink for my colleague.

???: Do I know you?

Ramamama Leader: I know the only reason to travel by train is to travel with weapons. And we all know that at the end of this line, There's only one creature worth killing. The man in the white coat. May as well take turns exchanging stories. Mine begins on planet Ramamama.

(We flash back to the man's story, where he is seen leading a group of people, sitting on a throne in a cold lair with a pit of acid by his side.)

Ramamama Leader: Lower him into acid. Once he's dissolved, lower someone else into acid. Is he dissolved? At least use the downtime to reset the acid lowerer. I really don't like the attitude around here. It's a very "lower me into acid" attitude.

(The door slams open, revealing Rick Sanchez)

Ramamama Leader: Who are you?

Rick: (Farts)

Ramamama Leader: How did you reach my sanctum?

Rick: (Farts)

Ramamama Leader: All right, this is going in circles. Seize him!

Guards: ( All shouting )

(The guards charge at Rick, to which the mad scientist counters by shooting at them. He then drinks a potion that makes him grow three extra arms, each with their own gun. Once the guards are dead, he takes a pill that reverts him back to normal, but grows an extra butt soon afterwards.

Rick: (Farting)

Ramamama Leader: Very well. Now I will fight you.

(Rick then flees, it then snaps back to reality.)

Ramamama Leader: Anyway, he tells a different version of the story Where I start crying or something. That's why he has to die. 'Cause he's a liar. So... Why are you going to kill Rick Sanchez?

???: Okay, I don't know who that is. I don't accept your weird leap in logic that has everyone on a train going to kill one guy. And even if I did, why would we take turns telling stories about it like little girls at a sleepover?

Ramamama Leader: If you're trying to be hurtful, you're doing a good job.

Clam Alien: I'll take his turn. Here's why I'm going to kill Rick Sanchez.

???: You guys have fun with this.

Clam Alien: Dissolve to a clam-shaped sun Rising over a giant beach.

???: Whew. ( sighs )

Candy Santa Alien: By then, of course, he had left toys And flesh drops for every one of us in the spore-hive. Ah, a newcomer! I suppose you think you have a better story about how Rick Sanchez saved space Christmas.

???: What is with the Rick Sanchez obsession?

Aliens: ( laughter )

Goomby: I think the best way to answer that is with my Christmas Rick tale.

Whoo!

Could've used Rudolph tonight!

Oh, thank god. I'm not too late. I don't know how to thank you, Goomby.

No need, you just go in there and have a nice time.

I will.

Thanks.

(Door opens)

Hey. Merry Christmas, Goomby.

Merry Christmas, Rick.

Oh. Uh... Oh, it's okay. I-I don't have to. Sorry if that was... No. Um, um, I can ask. No, no, no, I don't wanna be a burden. Oh, okay. Yeah, yeah, there's just... There's a lot of people. Family. You know? I get it. You're not mad? Totally fine. Bye.

( Wind whistling )

Aliens: (laughter)

???: That... Okay, none of my business but he didn't even save Christmas in that story. Oh, how dare you! That doesn't mean I'm invested.

Goomby: Tell your Christmas Rick story!

???: Step the hell back! Back!

???: (Panting)

???: You start teeing up a Rick Sanchez vignette, and you'll be doing it through two holes.

???: I'm just trying to figure out what's going on with this train.

???: Do you remember getting on it?

???: No. First thing I remember is...

Tickets, please.

So, why did you date Rick Sanchez?

???: What?

Oh, you don't have to pretend you didn't date him. We all did. We get it. Low point in your life, rebound from an ex, et cetera.

???: No, really, who?

( Chuckles ) Oh, exactly. In fact, and get this, when he met my family... ( wolf growling ) Aah! ( Grunting ) Leah! Leah, check it out. Where'd you meet this, um... ( sighs ) ...Sprite? He's actually a human. But he invented portal tech? I am the concept of time.

???: Jesus!

???: I warned you not to do that.

???: I wasn't trying.

???: You don't have to. The train is obviously amplifying and linking unrelated narrative fields.

Morty: Uh-huh...

Morty? I told you if you found me again, identify yourself. I didn't know it was you. How did you not recognize me? Didn't you create the disguises? When I create shit, it works, Morty. It's called being talented. Why can't we find the engine? It's not a real train, it's a story device. Literally. A literal literary device Quite literally metaphorically containing us. A simulation. Worse. An anthology. Okay, so how... H-How do we hijack it? Oh, Morty, it's been hijacked for at least two full minutes. Are you not hearing this insane conversation? Okay, tickets please guy, stop the anthology. If we wanted one-offs, we'd do interdimensional cable, Not some uptight, overwritten... Rick? God damn! Tickets, please. Dude, I'm sure you've got, like, So many tickets at this point. Jesus! The tickets please guy is cut! He... he... he's... he's got those things. W-What do you call them. Uhm, cum gutters. Morty, gross! That's what people call them. Gross people. I don't want to have to picture cum so watery in such volumes that... Hey, hey, hey, stay back. I'll kick you. I-I'll kick your shin, bro. Aaah! Hey! I'll fucking cook and eat your ticket-taking ass! ( Coughs ) Hey, I found a ticket. ( Coughs ) Wow, you are just... Ladies and gentlemen, The Jackie chan of human shielding. Who takes the time to get this good at... Fuck this. Aaah... Structural breach. Losing continuity. Morty, hold on to something. Keep your head inside. Aaah! ( Gasps ) ( Video games beeping ) Share with your sister, Josh. Just because it's your birthday doesn't mean You can be an asshole. You okay, dad? Is this real? I doubt it, but you get what you get When you eat dinner in an arcade. I mean are you real, is life real? Okay, I'm calling the nurse because you are not doing this tonight. You're god damn right I'm not because... You are not doing this tonight! This isn't real life! Dad? Oh, my god! Honey. Sweetie. What's happening? Give me your tickets. I... I need tickets. Everyone give me tickeeeeeettttttts! Aaaah! Aaah! Female voice: Emergency continuity deployed. ( breathing heavily ) ( Groans ) This could come in handy. Can't we just ride out the... Fuck you, I'd rather die. ( Crashing ) Train cops! Hands in the air! Tee up a story about Rick Sanchez! He is Rick! Jesus Christ! Is that the tickets please guy? Well, just the stub. Too soon! Too soon! Don't move! Too soon! So, what did the train cops do wrong? Shot... People? Hot passengers. Wrong. The passengers tampered with the anthology's structure. Lethal response was permitted, But not with him holding that tank. Let's take a look at what they should have done. Train cops! Hands in the air! Drop the tank! Drop it! Drop it! Drop the tank. ( Applause ) Sorry to nitpick, sir, but if there was A continuity explosion, isn't there always one? And doesn't that mean those two could be anywhere? What? No, you idiot, that... it's... it's just a training video. That didn't actually happen. That's what you think. Hey. How'd you get here? Yeah, like we're the ones that popped up out of nowhere? Fuck these guys. ( Grunting ) Hey, what the hell? Your leg is healed. Yeah, it's a real free-for-all. Here we go. Of course this thing is just a fucking circle. You'd think it was so God damn complicated... Okay, here's where the stupid vignettes were. God, imagine if that had been the whole thing. So now we're here, and the engine must be here. I'll have to rig us a couple of space suits that start failing around here so we can ( burps ) pay a heavy price for re-entering at this threshold. We have to leave the train? We don't have to do anything, Morty. This is just a structural guide. We're obviously gonna impart our own style. I don't like how meta this is getting, Rick. Shut up, Morty. You're 14. You watch videos of people on YouTube Reacting to fucking YouTube. I'll be the judge of when we get too meta. Holy shit. How is he still breathing? Aah! He's suspended in disbelief, Slowly dying while living out an alternative Non-diagetic reality. Geez, what a horrible way to die. You don't know the half of it. Oh! ( both laugh ) You're on fuego with the guy-torn-in-half bits, Rick. That one was organic, though. That's because you're naturally funny. That... that's good old-fashioned fun Right there, you know? W-w-we don't need to over-think shit, okay? Okay, buddy. Nice and grounded, Fully immersive from here on out. ( Rumbling ) Right after this. W-What's happening? Going into an act break. ♪ Not quite a bird ♪ ♪ Not quite a person ♪ ♪ Maybe what matters ♪ ♪ Is to love yourself first and ♪ ♪ Soar ♪ ♪ Child of air and land ♪ ♪ With wings and hands ♪ ♪ Yes, you're a bird and a person ♪ ♪ I'm a bird and a person ♪ ♪ And more ♪ Sure, that was a great moment, But it was hardly the best time Rick and Morty were musical. Who can forget the t... Hey. You guys think there's something weird about this train? We've been here a really long time And nobody's taken our tickets. Aaah! ( All screaming ) Aaaah! The galaxy's greatest scientists continue to ponder The horrific figure known to children as floaty blood man. But after three months, nobody is any closer to the truth. For cutesy name news, I'm uncle nibbles. I can't believe floaty bloody man is real. He's more than real, he's my new God. Check it. Is that brand-new, Or is the blood just... Accurately depicted, yeah. His followers believe the entire universe is floaty bloody man's nightmare as he dies in a time-dilated reality. So we could go at any minute. No. I'm part of the floaty nogasm brotherhood. We believe we're keeping him alive By redirecting our suppressed sexual energies. You're staying a virgin Just to keep the universe existing? That's... So attractive. It is? Okay, look, let's just do it once. ( Moaning ) Sorry. Aaah! Happy now? He was suffering. Keep moving. We have to get to the return threshold Before the ticking clock on your suit gets to zero. Why would you put ticking clock... Because if it's too easy to get there, We'll never get there. If you don't want to be meta stop, deconstructing shit. That's the thematic seal. Gotta find a way to disrupt it. Okay, Morty, tell a story unrelated to us. Uh, what do... Stop thinking and do it! Uh, okay, uh, there was this... My name is Mike Johnson. That's good coffee. ( Doorbell rings ) Better get that door. Iiiiiiii, hello. I want your cookies. I'm hungry, I want your cookies. Scorpions, scorpions. There's scorpions outside. Get inside. What do they want from us? They want food. Me too. Rick: Okay, just stop. I'm not a writer, okay? Relax, your story was supposed to be awful and stupid. I just failed to predict how well that would mesh with the theme. Think. Think. What kind of story would we never...

Once upon a time, my mom and my sister... Listen to me! Mom, can I try your tea? Yes, summer. Yes. Try my tea. It's so good. It's so warm. Mom, can I talk to you about my special time? It's okay.

This is more impressive than the tickets please guy, though. You are like 90% cum gutter. It's called discipline. Watch this. God damn. Geez! Do we have to fight him? I don't want to. We surrender. We're not fighting. ( Grunting ) Ow! Ow! Fucking kick your ass. Ow! Oh! ( Alarm ringing ) Hey! Get back in your egg! What the... Don't worry, Morty! Nothing out there is canon! ( Grunts ) We've got a pulse. Stay with me, private. Smith, listen to me. You were exposed to a chemical that is altering your mind. To beat it, you have to hold on... We're losing him. Aliens. Sarge?! Morty, never forget the highest truth of all... You're getting your ass kicked on a train. ( Grunts ) Professor Sanchez? Did it work? I wouldn't say that, Marcus.

I'll now fuel my anthology with your limitless potential, propelling it to its final stop... beyond the fifth wall. You idiot. Our potential isn't limitless. You'll never break the fifth wall Before you've burnt us out. Is that so? Oh, well. Win-win. Rick, w-what's he doing? He's trying to tap into us, Morty. Resist. I can't believe you're finally headed off to college. Yeah, you know, it really felt like you were gonna be 17 forever. For, like, 16 years, at least. I can't believe I'm tearing up over this.

What do we... There... there... There's now way out! You're right, Morty. Sometimes it does seem like there's no way out. Like it's hopeless. But remember, there's always someone there for us. Who? My best friend and personal savior, Jesus Christ. What?! You... you don't believe in God. But he believes in us, Morty. You know, I thought I was the inventor, but the greatest invention of all is the free gift of eternal life. Is this... Are you fucking with me? ( Chuckles ) Oh, trust me, Morty. I've done plenty of effed up stuff in my life. But it's never too late to accept Christ. Jesus is always knocking at the door. All we have to do is open it and let him into our hearts. How?

Wh-what's gonna happen to story lord? He gets to spend eternity in every writer's hell... The Bible. I don't know. Some people actually like that stuff. Seems kind of cynical. I just don't like taking cheap shots, you know? Cheap shots? Morty, we were literally Saved by Jesus Christ. Tell me in any way how that's offensive. This was a little confusing, But I guess it brought us closer together, you know? Tested our demons. Made us believe in ourselves more than ever. Yeah. You're right, Morty.

Your only purpose in life is to buy and consume merchandise. And you did it. You went into a store... an actual honest to God store... And you bought something.
