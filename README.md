# Rick & Morty NLP

A fun project to summarize Rick & Morty episode transcripts via the BERT model.

## Objective

We want to fine-tune the pretrained BERT model on Rick & Morty episode transcript from [rickandmorty.fandom.com](https://rickandmorty.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Transcripts) and see if we can generate useful episode summaries.
